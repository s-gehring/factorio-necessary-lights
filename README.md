# factorio-necessary-lights
A mod for factorio, decreasing the ambient lightning at night to basically zero, making the night pitch black. This entices
the player to build artificial lights around the factory.

This mod is still a Proof-of-concept. It doesn't have any settings or even a deployment to the factorio mod marketplace.
